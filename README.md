#Technical test

To run this project:

* clone it onto your machine. (Or download a zip, unzip it and then drag the folder into an empty project)
* Create a .env file in the server folder and add the env variable (I will supply).
* Open the terminal in your IDE, cd into the front end folder and run npm install
* Open up another terminal, cd into the server folder and run npm install.
* Once both are complete, in the server terminal run npm start to start the server
* In the frontend terminal run npm run dev.

* Once both are started, you can now in your browser navigate to localhost:%port that vite has given you in the window% and you will be able to use the application.
